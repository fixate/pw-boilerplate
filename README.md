# ProcessWire Boilerplate

A boilerplate for new ProcessWire projects. The templates are structure to use the [delegate approach](http://processwire.com/talk/topic/740-a-different-way-of-using-templates-delegate-approach/), so make sure to set all templates to use `main.php` as an alternate template by visiting:

```
Setup -> [template] -> Advanced -> Alternate Template Filename
```
in your admin.

## Purpose

Kickstart ProcessWire projects, and provide a structure which is more suitable to an MVC approach.

## Usage

Clone this repo into

```
site
├── templates
```

and get cracking!
